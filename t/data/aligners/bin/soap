Usage:  soap [options]
    -a  <str>   query a file, *.fq, *.fa
    -b  <str>   query b file
    -D  <str>   reference sequences indexing table, *.index format
    -o  <str>   output alignment file(txt)
    -M  <int>   match mode for each read or the seed part of read, which shouldn't contain more than 2 mismaches, [4]
                0: exact match only
                1: 1 mismatch match only
                2: 2 mismatch match only
                4: find the best hits
    -u  <str>   output unmapped reads file
    -t          output reads id instead reads name, [none]
    -l  <int>   align the initial n bps as a seed [256] means whole length of read
    -n  <int>   filter low-quality reads containing >n Ns before alignment, [5]
    -r  [0,1,2] how to report repeat hits, 0=none; 1=random one; 2=all, [1]
    -m  <int>   minimal insert size allowed, [400]
    -x  <int>   maximal insert size allowed, [600]
    -2  <str>   output file of unpaired alignment hits
    -v  <int>   maximum number of mismatches allowed on a read. [5] bp
    -s  <int>   minimal alignment length (for soft clip) [255] bp
    -g  <int>   one continuous gap size allowed on a read. [0] bp
    -R          for long insert size of pair end reads RF. [none](means FR pair)
    -e  <int>   will not allow gap exist inside n-bp edge of a read, default=5
    -p  <int>   number of processors to use, [1]
