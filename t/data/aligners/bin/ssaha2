DESCRIPTION:

ssaha2Build  This program constructs the hashtable
             required by the other ssaha2 programs.
             This provides an index for the given subject
             sequence.

ssaha2       This program aligns query sequences against a
             subject hashtable.

ssahaSNP     ssahaSNP is a polymorphism detection tool.
             It detects homozygous SNPs and indels by aligning
             shotgun reads to the finished genome sequence.
             From the best alignment, SNP candidates are
             screened, taking into account the quality value
             of the bases with variation as well as the quality
             values in the neighbouring bases, using
             neighbourhood quality standard (NQS).

USAGE:
   *************************************************************
   * NOTE: SSAHA2 & SSAHASNP COMMAND LINE FORMATS HAVE CHANGED *
   *       with version 1.0.9                                  *
   *************************************************************

      ssaha2Build [OPTIONS] -save <hash name> <subject file>

      ssaha2 [OPTIONS] -save <hash name> <query file> [<query file 2nd>]
      ssaha2 [OPTIONS] <subject file> <query file> [<query file 2nd>]

      ssahaSNP [OPTIONS] -save <hash name> <query file>
      ssahaSNP [OPTIONS] <subject file> <query file>

   where <subject file> and <query file> are fasta or fastq files with
   the reference (subject) and query sequence files. <hash name> is
   the root name of the hash table files created from the reference
   sequence using ssaha2Build.
   The paired-end module invoked with the -pair option (see below)
   expects two query files with file <query file> containing the first
   and <query file 2nd> containing the second mate of each pair. The
   mates of a paired-end read must occur at the same postion in the
   sequence of reads in <query file> and <query file 2nd>. The paired-
   end module is not available for ssahaSNP.

OPTIONS:

 -h, -help     Print this page.
 -v, -version  Print version information.
 -c, -cookbook Print some example parameter sets, suitable
               for common tasks.

All other options, except the '-solexa' and '-454' flags and the
'-output ssaha2 cigar' option, are key-value pairs. Options are described below
(default values in brackets):

 -save <FILENAME>
            ssaha2Build: Root name of the files to which the
                         hash table is saved. The set of files
                         have the extensions FILENAME.head FILENAME.body
                         FILENAME.name FILENAME.base FILENAME.size
            ssaha2, ssahaSNP: Read hash table from files created by ssaha2Build.
                       If -save is not specified then the first file name
                         specifies the reference sequence for which a hash
                         table is constructed on the fly

 -kmer      Word size for ssaha hashing (13).

 -skip      Step size for ssaha hashing (13).

 -ckmer     Word size for cross_match matching (10).

 -cmatch    Minimum match length for cross_match matching (14).

 -cut       Number of repeats allowed before this kmer is ignored (10000).

 -seeds     Number of kmer matches required to flag a hit (5).

 -depth     Number of hits to consider for alignment (50).

 -memory:   Memory assigned in MBs for the alignment matrix (200).

 -port      Port number for server (60000).

 -align     If set to > 0, output graphical alignment (0).
            If set to 2 and -solexa flag is set: output also quality score.

 -edge      (obsolete as of release 2.0.0) Augment hit by this many bases
            before alignment (200).

 -array:    Memory assigned in bytes for frequency arrays (4000000).

 -start:    first sequence to process in query (0).

 -end:      last sequence to process in query, 0 means process all (0).

 -sense     (obsolete as of release 2.0.0) Allow really patchy hits to go
            for alignment (0).

 -best      If set to 1, only report the best alignment for each
            match, if multiple best scores report all (0).

 -454:      (see -rtype) Tune for 454 reads (0). Implies '-skip 3 -seeds 2
            -score 30 -sense 1 -cmatch 10 -ckmer 6'

 -NQS:      Use NQS to filter SNPs if set to 1, otherwise output all
            candidates (1).

 -quality:  Quality value to use for variation base in NQS (23).

 -tags:     If set to 1, prefix added to output summary lines to
            aid parsing, the prefix depends upon the chosen
            output format, e.g. if output is ssaha2 then the
            prefix is ALIGNMENT (1).

 -output:   ssaha2       - original ssaha2 line only (default)
            sugar        - Simple UnGapped Alignment Report
            cigar        - Compact Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report
            vulgar       - Verbose Useful Labelled Gapped Alignment Report
            psl          - Tab separated format similar to BLT
                         http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html
            pslx         - Tab separated format with sequence
            gff          - http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF/
            ssaha2 cigar - alternate between ssaha2 and cigar format lines
            aln          - Tony Cox' alignment output format.
            sam          - SAM format (http://samtools.sourceforge.net). Output
                           is written to a file specified with the -oufile flag.

            sam_soft     - SAM format using soft clipping. The entire read is
                           output./n/n            for a full description of output formats see:
                 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/SSAHA2/formats.shtml

 -name      Flag that modifies option '-output cigar' such that read name
            and length are also reported when there was no hit found.

 -diff:     Output all hits within diff of the best (-1).

 -udiff:    Ignore best hit if second best score within udiff (0).

 -fix:      If set to 1, fix -edge, -seeds, -score so that they
            are not updated according to read length in ssahaSNP (0).

 -disk:     0: map all files into memory including the query sequences. (0)
            1: read hashtable body, the subject and query sequences from disk
               rather than loading them into memory.
            2: like 1 but the subject sequences are read into memory. The body
               is left on the disk.
            In both cases the query sequence file is not mapped into memory.
 -weight:   If >0, apply this much weighting to rare kmers (0).

 -solexa:   (see -rtype) implies (ssaha2 and ssahaSNP only):
            -kmer 13 -skip 2 -seeds 2 -score 12 -cmatch 9 -ckmer 6.
            Top scoring hits with lower quality at the mismatch positions
            have their Smith-Waterman score incremented by 1. Mapping
            scores are changed accordingly. SsahaSNP reports in such cases
            only the top scoring hit (no Repeat lines).

 -rtype:    solexa          - like -solexa flag
            454             - like -454 flag
            abi             - tunes for ABI reads (default)

 -pair <dist_lower>,<dist_upper>: Map paired-end reads with an insert length in
            the interval [<dist_lower>,<dist_upper>]. The reads for each mate
            are in a separate input file named by the last two tokens of the
            command line. The sequence for both mates are read in the same
            direction. Paired-end reads are reported if the mates match within
            <dist_upper> bases from each other, but at least <dist_lower> bases
            apart. No mate is reported, if the mapping is ambiguous, i.e. if
            there are multipe hits with the same Smith-Waterman alignment score
            in the specified distance range.
            If hits are found only for one mate, the highest scoring hit is
            reported for this mate unless it is ambiguous.

 -outfile <file_name> Output file for output in SAM format or, if the -pair
            option is set, for mate pairs that map outside the specified
            distance range unambiguously (each with a mapping score > 30, or a
            value set with the -mthresh option below).

 -mthresh <mapping_score>  Threshold in the mapping score for mate pairs to be
            reported that map outside the distance range (see option -outfile).
            <mapping_score> is an integer between 0 and 50 (default: 30).
            This option requires the -pair option to be set.

 -multi <rand_seed> Flag modifying the way paired-end reads with multiple
            (repetitive) mappings are reported. If rand_seed == 0: skip such
            pairs entirely. if rand_seed> 0: select one pair at random.
            <rand_seed> seeds the random number generator.
