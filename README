Installation:

perl Build.PL --install_base your_dir
./Build
./Build installdeps --cpan_client 'cpan -i' #to install cpan dependencies, ensure cpan was built with the perl you are using for this build
./Build test
./Build install

Where real bioinformatics tools are used in tests, an attempt to dynamically assert presence of tools is made and those tests are skipped. If TOOLS_INSTALLED environment variable is true, the tests that require presence of tools are run.
